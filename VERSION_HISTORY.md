## Version History Log

### **v0.06 — Multi-Theme Engine & Semantic Token System**
- **`v0.06.03`** *(Current)*
  - **In-App Encrypted Backup Passphrase Modal**: Replaced raw browser `prompt()` dialog with a dark glassmorphic modal in `SettingsView.vue` (`#0f1019` container, `#1f202e` borders, `backdrop-blur-md`), featuring target filename banner, password visibility eye toggle button, 8-character validation, and sleek action buttons (`Cancel` and `Encrypt & Share`).
  - **Floating Glassmorphic Island Nav Dock**: Mobile bottom navigation in `App.vue` styled as a floating capsule island (`bottom-3 rounded-3xl backdrop-blur-xl bg-[#0c0d14]/90 border border-[#1f202e] shadow-2xl`) with active tab glow pills.
  - **Ambient Radial Breathing Pie Chart Glow**: Multi-stop `<radialGradient>` and smooth 3.5s breathing pulse animation (`animate-breathe-glow`) on both Home (`Dashboard.vue`) and History (`TransactionList.vue`) charts.
  - **Android Production Build**: Rebuilt Capacitor Android assets and compiled debug APK (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 9s`).
- **`v0.06.02`**
  - **Ambient Radial Breathing Pie Chart Glow**: Replaced flat SVG blur circles with a multi-stop `<radialGradient>` and smooth 3.5s breathing pulse animation (`animate-breathe-glow`) on both Home (`Dashboard.vue`) and History (`TransactionList.vue`) charts.
  - **Floating Glassmorphic Island Nav Dock**: Transformed mobile bottom navigation bar in `App.vue` into a floating capsule island dock (`bottom-3 rounded-3xl backdrop-blur-xl bg-[#0c0d14]/90 border border-[#1f202e]`) with glowing active tab capsule highlights and an elevated center `+` FAB button.
  - **Native Backup Direct Save & WhatsApp Attachment Fix**: Fixed Android Capacitor file sharing bug in `services/api.js` by omitting text body strings so WhatsApp attaches actual `.sqlite3`/`.db`/`.json` file binaries. Created `saveNativeFile()` helper to save backup files directly to device `Documents` folder without popping up the native share sheet.
- **`v0.06.01`**
  - Expanded **Multi-Theme Engine** to 7 theme presets with light theme variants: `nordic-light` (Frost Blue `#0284c7`) and `emerald-light` (Forest Mint `#059669`).
  - **High-Contrast Light Mode Overrides**: Resolved text contrast bugs, mapped arbitrary Tailwind hex utilities (`bg-[#...]`, `text-[#...]`, `border-[#...]`, `hover:bg-[#...]`) to semantic CSS variable tokens.
  - **Card Hover & Active State Fixes**: Replaced pitch-black hover boxes (`hover:bg-[#141520]`) with dynamic container highlights (`var(--bg-container-high)`).
  - **Interactive Spotlight Tour Auto-Centering**: Fixed off-screen tour element bugs by adding instant centered scrolling (`scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'auto', block: 'center' })`), multi-frame coordinate passes, and strict viewport clamping for tour highlight cutouts and tooltips.
  - **Responsive PC Mouse Drag-and-Drop**: Updated `handleDragPointerDown()` in `SettingsView.vue` so PC mouse users drag instantly on `pointerdown` while maintaining 180ms long-press delays for mobile touch scrolling.
  - **Light Mode UI & Divider Refinements**: Redesigned Delete buttons with high-contrast light-red containers (`bg-rose-500/10 text-rose-600`), standardized uniform 1px list dividers (`divide-y divide-[#1f202e] border border-[#1f202e] rounded-xl overflow-hidden`), unified directory tile icon colors in More Hub, and updated Savings Buckets descriptions to *"Virtual divisions of money"*.
  - **Android Production Build**: Rebuilt Capacitor Android project and compiled fresh APK (`app-debug.apk`, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 9s`).
- **`v0.06.00`**
  - Implemented the **Multi-Theme Engine** with 5 customizable visual presets:
    1. 🌙 **Pastel Dark** (Material 3 Dark Pastel default)
    2. 🖤 **OLED Pitch Black** (Pure `#000000` AMOLED screen battery saver)
    3. ❄️ **Nordic Slate** (Deep arctic slate blue & cyan accent)
    4. 🌲 **Emerald Midnight** (Deep forest green & mint accent)
    5. ☀️ **Pastel Light** (Soft warm light theme)
  - Created theme utility module (`utils/theme.js`) and added `[data-theme="..."]` CSS custom property token definitions to `style.css`.
  - Vault-isolated persistence: Theme preferences are saved per vault database in the SQLite `vault_settings` table (`vault_theme`).
  - Added interactive **"App Theme & Appearance"** launcher modal (`ThemeModal.vue`) under Settings.
  - Web production build compiled cleanly (`✓ built in 1.36s`).

### **v0.05 — Multi-Currency System & Native Drag-and-Drop Polish**
- **`v0.05.20`**
  - Rebuilt the **Initial Quick Vault Setup Wizard** & **Interactive Spotlight Tour** system from scratch with robust architecture and zero runtime errors.
  - **Setup Wizard (5 Steps)**: Step 1 (Currency Picker with live search and polymorphic code/object handling), Step 2 (Storage Accounts & Custom Creator with seed balances), Step 3 (Savings Buckets to keep money organized), Step 4 (Expense & Income Categories), Step 5 (Architecture Feature Rundown & Overview).
  - **Interactive Spotlight Tour (12 Steps)**: Cutout highlight overlay with mobile/desktop selector fallback (`add-tx-btn` / `add-tx-btn-mobile`), step-specific floating tooltip positioning to prevent modal overlap, re-worded savings buckets terminology, and a heartfelt Thank You message (`Thank You from Cash Buddy! ❤️`).
  - Added **"Take Tour Again"** banner card to **Settings $\rightarrow$ FAQ & Guides**.
  - Re-synced and assembled Android debug APK (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 8s`).
- **`v0.05.19`**
  - Fixed currency selection handler in `utils/currency.js` and `OnboardingModal.vue`: updated `setCurrency()` to be polymorphic, accepting both string codes (`'USD'`, `'EUR'`, `'INR'`) and currency objects.
  - Resolved issue where tapping currency cards on Step 1 of the setup wizard failed to apply.
- **`v0.05.18`**
  - Resolved Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) initialization crash in `Dashboard.vue`: moved `filteredCategoryExpenses`, `totalExpenses`, `filteredCategoryIncome`, and `totalIncome` computed variables above `animateNumberTicker()` and `watch([netWorth, totalIncome, totalExpenses])`.
  - Fixed `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization` and `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization` that crashed Vue reactivity on component mount.
- **`v0.05.17`**
  - Fixed race condition in `OnboardingModal.vue` stage watchers: consolidated `watch([() => props.isOpen, () => props.initialStage])` to guarantee spotlight DOM elements mount before calculating bounding rect coordinates.
  - Streamlined `openTutorial()` in `App.vue` for atomic stage updates.
  - Service worker caching strategy updated to `NetworkFirst` / `StaleWhileRevalidate` in `vite.config.js` to ensure fresh JS bundle delivery.

  - Converted pointer/drag event handlers in `SettingsView.vue` to hoisted function declarations to eliminate Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) minification crashes.

  - Re-synced and assembled Android debug APK.
- **`v0.05.15`**
  - Removed "Re-run Vault Setup Wizard" button from `SettingsView.vue` as requested.

  - Re-synced and assembled Android debug APK.
- **`v0.05.12`**
  - Resolved onboarding loop issue in `api.js`: updated `getOnboardingState()` to check both explicit `app_metadata` (`setup_complete = 'true'`) and `txCount > 0`.
  - Finishing or skipping the setup wizard now correctly saves `setup_complete = 'true'` to SQLite, allowing setup completion while ensuring brand new vaults (without transactions and without `setup_complete = 'true'`) mandatorily trigger setup.
  - Re-synced and assembled Android debug APK.
- **`v0.05.11`**
  - Fixed new vault setup modal state initialization in `OnboardingModal.vue`: added immediate watchers on `props.isOpen` to reset `setupStep = 1` and `isSpotlightTour = false` when opening new vaults.

- **`v0.05.09`**
